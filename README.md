# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The CEO of PyBer, V.Isualize had given us-me and Omar, a brand new assignment- in which we had to first use our python skills and knowledge of Pandas package to create a 
summary DataFrame, which in other words is a dataset or data structure containing certain information and a story to tell its audience, which in our case would be about the ride-sharing data by the city type. Next, we used the Matplotlib library to create a multiple line graph in order to visualize our previously created dataframe that displayed the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, we submited a written report that summarized how the data differs by each city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers, such as V.Isualize at PyBer.
## Results:
The following are some of the observations made during the analysis:
* The Urban cities had maximum number of drivers, rides and total fares as compared to the Suburban and the Rural cities.
* The Suburban cities had lesser than the Urban cities but more than the Rural cities- the number of drivers, rides and total fares, putting them in the middle.
* The Rural cities had the minimum number of drivers, rides and total fares.
* The Rural cities have the highest 'Average Fare per Ride' and 'Average Fare per Driver'.
* The Urban cities have the lowest 'Average Fare per Ride' and 'Average Fare per Driver'.
